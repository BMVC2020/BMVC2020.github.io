    title: "Multiple Object Tracking: Promising Directions and Data Privacy"
    job: Faculty at the Technical University of Munich
    abstract: "Is the performance on multiple object tracking benchmarks saturating? What seem to be promising new research directions? I will first analyze the performance of recent methods, and show how powerful a simple object detector regressor can be for MOT. This analysis will uncover the main challenges that as a community we are still not tackling.
I will then move towards end-to-end learning for MOT, and explain how graph neural networks can open the path to new research directions. Finally, I will show how computer vision tools can help us in handling data privacy in MOT benchmarks."

    title: "Towards Graph-Based Spatial AI"
    job: Faculty at Imperial College and Head of the Dyson Robitics Lab
    abstract: "To enable the next generation of smart robots and devices which can
truly interact with their environments, Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (SLAM) will progressively develop into a vision-driven
geometric and semantic `Spatial AI' perception capability which gives
devices the real-time dynamic model in which to reason in intuitive
and intelligent ways about their actions.  A fundamental issue is the
algorithmic architecture which will enable estimation and machine
learning components to come together to enable efficient, incremental
updating of scene representation, and I believe that graph strucures
where storage and computation come together will be the key. New
computing and sensing hardware is now becoming available which makes
research in this direction a reality."
